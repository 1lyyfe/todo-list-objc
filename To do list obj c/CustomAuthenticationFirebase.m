//In this class we sign in a user annonymously so they each have a unique firebase user uid so that we can store data against that. The firebase db should split data on each users device uid and then there tasks will each be stored under that key as childs. This would help with the future extensibility of this class as it would be easy to retrieve the uid later to upgrade them to a full acount perhaps
